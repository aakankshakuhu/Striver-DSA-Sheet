# Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet – Daily Practice

This repository documents my **daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice** using **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.

I am currently in my **3rd year of engineering (VI sesmester)**, and this repository represents a conscious decision to go back to the fundamentals, build strong problem-solving skills, and stay consistent — because it’s **never too late to start doing things the right way**.

## Why This Repository Exists

For a long time, DSA felt overwhelming.  
Instead of rushing through topics, I decided to:

- Slow down
- Practice daily
- Understand concepts deeply
- Build discipline over motivation

This repository is not about perfection.  
It is about **showing up every day and improving gradually**.

## How I’m Practicing DSA

- Following **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet** step by step
- Solving problems **daily**
- Writing clean and understandable solutions
- Focusing on **patterns, logic, and intuition**
- Revisiting mistakes and improving previous solutions

Each folder represents a step in the sheet and my progress through it.

This repository is a **learning log**, not just a collection of answers.

## A Note to Anyone Reading This

If you’re in your 3rd year (or later) and feel like you’re “late” — you’re not.

What matters is:
- starting
- staying consistent
- and not stopping

This repository is proof of that belief.

## Commitment

I aim to:
- Practice DSA **regularly**
- Keep improving my problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation for interviews and real-world problem solving

One problem at a time.

**Never too late. Just start.**
